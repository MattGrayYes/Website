The last 6 or 7 years have seen green shoots of regeneration begun by Turner Contemporary Gallery and is now rich in galleries, media consultants, music and film producers. Its High Street is an exemplar for retail re-purposing. Unfortunately, there remains a lot of deprivation and a widening digital divide.\r\n\r\nThis talk is an engineer\u2019s tale of moving to Margate from London. The opportunities, experiences and challenges had so far, and an ambition to bring more joy of tech to the area. I will talk about Margate's Maker community as context, and tell tales of working with artists and involvement with several community activities. I even mange to squeeze in a bit of IDEF0 modelling!\r\n",

Using videos & photos of the exhibit we also go into an explanation of how the aerodynamics, structures, performance and systems topics make the wing what it is.\r\n\r\nFor over a century, Bristol has been at the forefront of aeronautical and space technology, breaking boundaries to create the fastest, the biggest and the highest. Aerospace Bristol entertains & informs visitors with stories of human endeavour, individual genius and ordinary people achieving extraordinary things.",

But it wasn't always quite that way...\r\n\r\nThis talk will be a potted history of the safety of the railways in the UK and Ireland, starting from the early days when signalling was thought of as an inconvenience, and anything with wheels on it which sort-of went round went on the track. Eventually, the railway companies learned the benefits of adopting safer methods of working (sometimes requiring some encouragement from the law), leading to the introduction of some Victorian methods we still use today. Finally, we look at the more modern era with the railway losing its way with privatisation, and onto the current time, where computers and paperwork solve everything. Perhaps.\r\n\r\nFeaturing: Swiss Cheese, Charles Babbage vs. Brunel, working too hard, forgetting where you put your trains, losing your religion, a dark and stormy night, drunken driving, a loose screw, shifting foundations, and more.\r\n\r\nNo previous knowledge of the rail industry is required.

Little IoT devices that brought computers, toys and board game pieces together. In 2011(version one) and 2012 (version 2) a commercial version, Sifteo Cubes, was released, but I was unaware, thinking the dream prototype was just that, a dream not a reality. They passed me by\u2026\r\n\r\n In 2014, the v2 software was open sourced - the inevitable precursor to failure - and the company bought by Drone/Robotics developer for the obvious design skills of the Sifteo team; they had, after all, reverse engineered and reapplied wireless keyboard controllers into one of the coolest toys ever! So, I came to them late. Too late. By 2015, the server the control software required, along with the online marketplace for the dozen or so games that were made, were long gone. The Sifteo cubes I\u2019d just (re)discovered from a desperate eBay sale were now just useless, battery powered bricks. And they didn\u2019t even click together!\r\n\r\nBut I was stubborn. I wanted them to work. These little marvels of engineering and educational design. I had some of the software, a couple of the games, and none of the knowledge. Here\u2019s how I managed to resurrect a legend, who I met, what some of them stole from me, and what I learned on the way",

        "description": "Over my time in academia, I've endured a number of existential crises whilst learning about the concepts within philosophy that are required in order to undertake academic research. I figured that, if I'm going to spend the rest of my life constantly questioning my existence and reality itself, why not share this experience with others, too? A problem shared is still a problem that keeps you awake at night staring into the abyss unable to function. But hey, at least now I'm not alone.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain these theories and share my recurrent episodes of screaming WHYYYYYYYY at the universe, I've collected a number of memes and references over the years to convey concepts such as what is it to 'exist', why the scientific method is just as 'made up' as anything else, how we define 'truth' and lots of other tasty things to create a pervasive, disjointed feeling that you just can't seem to shake. Join me in this journey and then we can all go and sit by the lake and have a good cry / scream / rock back and forth because what does it all mean and what even is real anyway and I'm off to go eat a cake because while I can't actually prove if the cake is a lie or not I'm convinced it is damn tasty and I NEED TO FEEL SOMETHING OTHER THAN THIS EXISTENTIAL UNCERTAINTY FOREVER OKAY?",

How can biometric and immersive development tools be used in the computing classroom and dance studios to raise awareness of data ethics and immersive performance tools? \r\n\r\nWe created 3D motion capture data from 2D RGB video sources using AI software. We recorded and visualised EEG using cheaply available equipment. We are currently producing a performance in Augmented Reality, using game development tools for animation data visualisation, particle systems, fragment shaders, etc. And data sonification with Python and Sonic PI.\r\n\r\nWe will give a video demonstration of work in progress augmented reality ballet using the concepts we have developed.

An ingeniously simple and elegant combination of cogs, wires and lamps, all fitting into a portable case, it provided some of the strongest encryption possible at the time. During various Covid-19 lockdowns, I decided to re-enact this important development in the history of computing, through a project to build an Enigma machine at home, using modern components and digital design techniques. The completed project is made out of cheap hobby electronics parts and laser-cut wood, and can be assembled entirely by hand, with no gluing, screwing or soldering. I will reflect on what this process taught me about the challenges of electromechanical computing, security and usability, the changes in modern manufacturing and supply chains, and their impact on computing. This will be followed by a Q&A and a demonstration where you can see the home-made Enigma machine in action and have a go at encrypting and decrypting a message.\"",

        "description": "Fashion tells a story of who we are, expressing the opinions and positions of both wearers and designers. Fashion-tech -- fashion embedded with programmable electronics -- offers more dynamic expressions for fashion. This talk will first discuss the importance and direction of fashion-tech in our society today and in the future. We will also discuss lessons learned from our collective 15 years of experience as fashion-tech designers and common issues designers face creating such garments. From our experience, we have begun research and development of a kit, that requires no coding and no soldering, to help designers move past technological barriers and enable more creative exploration during the design process. Lowering technical barriers not only affects fashion-tech but opens new possibilities for art and innovation.",

This started as a student / hobby project and is now receiving funding from the European Space Agency (ESA.) There are lots of interesting technical problems involved in making a VTVL rocket work. You need to steer the rocket engine and control its thrust based on data from a variety of sensors. This involves mechanical, electronics and coding challenges. When fully developed, the test vehicle we've developed will be used to test software and hardware that enable robots to land safely on other planets such as Mars.\r\n\r\nThe talk will start with an introduction to rocket engines and a simple explanation of the vehicle's dynamics then cover the development of our VTVL rocket from hobby project to successful flying test-bed. It will include video footage of recent test flights where the rocket takes off and hovers on a tethered test rig.\r\n",

Despite this short lifetime, a homebrew community formed, has not gone away, and has only become more passionate since. \r\n\r\nThe most tangible demonstrations of this passion are the extensive hardware modifications that have been developed by hobbyists to drag the Dreamcast kicking and screaming in to the 21st century. Users can restore internet connectivity, replace the PSU or the commonly-failing disk drive (originally based on bespoke optical media), and even enable true digital video output. \r\n\r\nI will talk about the origins of the Dreamcast homebrew scene, and the development and implementation of the most popular of these mods that ensure the Dreamcast will live on for many years to come.",

Surely they can't be that secure? After all, anyone can encode a magstripe - right? \r\n\r\nWe'll take a look through the data encoded on these tickets, what interesting things you can do with them and maybe (assuming I've got it working by then) we'll be able to read and write our own!

In this talk I will introduce the basics of railway signalling, and look at how it has evolved over time - often in response to accidents and near-misses. You will find out how a single stray wire caused an accident that killed 35 people, why leaves on the line cause such a problem for the railways, and how signalling systems are designed to deal with the inevitable human error. Working from the early days of the railway to the present (and future), the talk will take you through a number of accidents, their causes and the improvements that were made after the accidents.\r\n\r\nThis talk is suitable for any level of knowledge about railways - it aims to be understandable for complete beginners, and still have some interesting parts even for railway geeks.",

If my horse is too slow, I want a way to make it faster. It wasn't clear to many people of the 1800s that changes in industrialisation would lead to an entirely new way of going fast! \r\n\r\nSo what happens when you do have all of the information, and when you can find subtle patterns occurring in vast swathes of data?

Transport for London provides an API (\"TrackerNet\") to get departure boards for all the stations -- but (ab)using that information to track the journeys of each individual train has proven much harder than expected.\r\n\r\nI'll explain how I built a system to squeeze useful insights out of an API not really designed to provide them -- including a fair few workarounds for TfL's capricious signalling systems, way more graph theory than I have any right doing, and why I now really hate the District Line. You'll be able to see how applying a carefully tuned pile of random maths lets me go from a chaotic jumble of data to a near-perfect model of the Tube map!\r\n\r\nI'll also cover the practicalities of running this system, explaining how I packaged it all up into a website people can actually use without getting banned by TfL for using their API too much or overloading the server I run it on.\r\n\r\nDon't let the mention of graph theory scare you off; this talk should be appropriate for all audiences, and should appeal to anyone with a casual interest in railways, open data, or infrastructure.",

        "description": "I'm an artist creating interactive installations. The hardest part is devising open-ended interaction, spaces that invite people to reveal their authentic selves, and to connect with those around.\r\n\r\nBut trends in technology have gone in the opposite direction. Whether it's for usability, profit, safety, profit or 'sparking joy', or profit (it's usually profit), 'User Experience Design' was the flavour of the 2010s. Human-Computer Interaction has become a very planned affair. And the more planned it gets, the less room there is for the ambiguous messy bits that make us human.\r\n\r\nCould it be another way? Presenting... \r\n\u272f\u272f\u272f Rewilding Human-Computer Interaction \u272f\u272f\u272f\r\nwhere, instead of designing micromanaged user experiences, we create open-ended spaces that embrace the unknown, the messy and the human. The ills of the online world are not problems inherent to its users but to systems that prevent those users from existing fully as humans. The solution is not more design, but more wildness.\r\n\r\nSoapbox aside, I do have a speculative project to share on this front.\r\n\r\nIn a collaboration with artist/AI researcher Panagiotis Tigas, we've been training Variational Autoencoders on improvised dance, and from these devising personalised interfaces that respond to creative movement. The resulting system allows you to move through a 16-dimensional parameter space while following the intuitions of the body. As an entangled black box system, I can't explain how to use it, but it can be learnt by the body through exploration and play.\r\n\r\nWe have it here at EMF as in Latent Voyage, letting you navigate the hallucinatory latent space of an image generating AI.",

Why then does it feel so incredibly hard to make these collaborations happen in reality? And why does it feel even harder to do it while meaningfully fighting the Tories, transphobes, racists, and neo-Nazis?\r\n\r\nThis talk takes it back to the roots of why we are here and what we\u2019re doing to explore why. I will break down how harmful neoliberal methodologies that dominate tech groupthink such as Human Centered Design and Design Thinking fundamentally restrict what can be made whilst presenting a cardboard cutout \u201cethics\u201d that falls over at the slightest touch.\r\n\r\nInstead I introduce Community Technology Partnerships, a methodology developed at Geeks for Social change in collaboration with Manchester School of Architecture, based on \u201cthe capability approach\u201d. This is a human development approach used by the UN and WHO developed by Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen that asks what people are able to *be* and *do,* and works to remove blockers to these concrete actions and states. This approach recentres community strengths at the centre of more holistic tech interventions that restore power to the people who need it the most.\r\n\r\nNotes for this talk are here: https://gfsc.studio/emf22\r\n",

        "description": "The hurdy-gurdy is an ancient musical instrument (10th century) with drones and melody strings bowed by a rotating wheel, played by pressing keys which contact them at different points. It featured in TV series such as \u201cBlack Sails\u201d and \u201cWalking Dead\u201d as well computer games. A major barrier is that they are very expensive at thousands of pounds each and built to order with lead times of over a year. Rather like bagpipes, they are loud. For pipers, practice e-chanters are available while nothing similar exists for the hurdy-gurdy. The Digi-Gurdy project started as a 3D printed version of the keyboard part of the instrument in isolation, with some internal electronics, for my own personal use to learn a few tunes on. After posting on Thingiverse, a website for sharing 3D printed ideas, I had many requests from people asking me to build them one. This open-source project has developed through many variations which I would bring to the talk, resulting in an all laser-cut wooden full-size hurdy gurdy design with a realistic crank handle system and a detachable playable keybox for travelling. It is an electronic device, with correctly placed keys, that outputs data via the industry standard MIDI communications system for electronic musical instruments, via a USB cable to an attached or wirelessly paired phone or iPad running suitable MIDI player software. It is a low-cost way to enter the Hurdy Gurdy world and allows practice anywhere using headphones, thus preventing eviction or divorce!",

        "description": "Should we really be trying to make our tech indistinguishable from magic? Is there dark magic in tech? And what does that have to do with a teleporting duck in a classroom?!\r\n\r\nWe often hold creating 'a magical experience' as a key goal for design - it's fun, engaging, sometimes even playful, and it makes complex things look simple. But technological magic has a dark side too, especially when trying to help people learn and feel confident about technology.\r\n\r\nBy its nature, magic you experience is not under your control: it's a trick, and you're not supposed to be able to understand it; magic is inscrutable, and for many, that's disempowering.\r\n\r\nIn designing the BBC micro:bit and surrounding tools, we've thought a lot about the balance between the positive and the negative sides of creating of a magical experience.\r\n\r\nThis talk will reflect on our struggle to balance technical authenticity and honesty with the need to provide a high quality experience that excites and inspires students.\r\n\r\nIt will explain how we attempt to present simple, understandable analogs of more complicated, magical technology in order to help students gain a sense confidence with the tech around them.  However, it will also look at how we've resorted to using our own bits of (nearly) invisible magic to make this all work nicely in a classroom.\r\n\r\nThrough this discussion we'll look in detail at the presentation of the micro:bit's IO, the way the micro:bit's USB interface works, the microphone privacy LED, the web-based compiler and the simple radio communication.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will look beyond micro:bit at how using this concept of balancing transparency and magic can help us build better, more trustworthy tech.",

Tourism films are no use in a war, so the Council turned their topics towards more cultural content as a softer kind of propaganda. Thus began a decade of film production that would have phenomenal overseas impact but be almost totally forgotten in Britain. \r\n\r\nBetween 1940\u20131950, the British Council produced over 120 short documentary-style films about life in Britain covering sports, manufacturing, landscapes, art, architecture, public healthcare, the justice system, democratic process, public institutions like the National Trust and the BBC, and more besides. \r\nA far cry from the Ministry of Information's rigid style, this collection features some of the earliest works by winning cinematographers Geoffrey Unsworth (2001: A Space Odyssey, Cabaret, Superman), and Jack Cardiff (A Matter of Life and Death, Black Narcissus, The Red Shoes). \r\n\r\nDistributed to over 100 countries worldwide, the films are stunning, dated, funny, and bizarre by turn. They depict beautiful countrysides, optimistic cities, strong industry, forward-thinking social structures, and hardworking, happy people. They depict exactly the popular image of 1940s Britain that persists to this day... \r\nThat may not be a coincidence. \r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll cover the history and development of this film collection, how it was shaped, who saw the films, their staggering success, and their untold global legacy.",

As a baby scientist I set out to discover why babies laugh so much more than the rest of us and what it tells us about the human condition.

This technology has global potential to disrupt energy and wastewater systems.\r\n\r\nActive Living Infrastructure: Controlled Environment (ALICE) is a \"living\" installation that communicates with microbes in real time by monitoring their electricity production so we can \"respond\" to them by feeding them with our liquid waste. Drawing together microbial metabolism, data, bioprocessor systems, artificial intelligence, low power electronics and digital displays, ALICE reveals the inner \"life\" and naturally-organised, imperceptible realm of microbes around us. To hold these digital \"conversations\" with microbes, ALICE uses the Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) as a communications platform. MFCs are an organic energy source powered by microbes which facilitate contact between humans and microbes through electrical exchanges. The collected and analysed data can tell us about household resources, as microbes can give us information about our consumption, and reveal what we discard in our waste streams\u2014while also powering our homes and, ultimately, cities.\r\n\r\nhttps://alice-interface.eu\r\n\r\nCome and see us in Null Sector!",

Its work seeks to reveal the vulnerability of an art that is highly dependent on industrial logic. All the artworks that the collective reconstructs, as close as possible to the original materialities, sometimes in a deficient way, are treated as archives.\r\n\r\nThe artwork \"3615 Love\" is based on the reconstruction of telematic materialities (videotex, Minitel network, etc.) and the archive of works by Jacques-Elie Chabert and Camille Philibert (L'Objet perdu, 1985) and Eduardo Kac (Videotext Poems, 1985-1986). The installation \"3615 Love\" shows how fragile and vulnerable our digital environment - and a fortiori its artistic productions - is. \r\n",

After working on container ships as an engineer in the mid-2000s, it seemed every more unlikely. We didn't have a full-time Internet connection and all the vital systems were truly air-gapped. But things have changed - ships are becoming more and more connected and complex. \r\n\r\nAs a result, 15 years later, I found myself sat in my pants on the sofa with the ability to control the steering on one of the world's largest cruise ships. We've been able to brick every PLC across tens of oil rigs, pay for food as the captain, and write rude words on the side of the ship. \r\n\r\nTo get to this point, we had to go on a learning voyage across tens of different vessels, including offshore support tugs, super yachts, oil rigs and container ships. Join me on a whistle stop tour of what's on a ship, how it's all connected together, what threats there are and how we find the vulnerabilities. Lots of little tips and tricks that can help anyone examine industrial control systems, understand how they work, and then have a lot of fun with them!\r\n\r\nTesting work is carried out in my role as Security Consultant at Pen Test Partners",
